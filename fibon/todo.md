# Fibonacci Toy

- [x] Simple per request state on server (first.py)
- [x] Per client state in cookies (cookies.py)
- [x] algo version with count cookie (main.py)
- [ ] Fibonacci algorithm for arbitrary reqs


per client state could do with some more work as I think it repeats 1 twice. 

Does the algorithm have to be recursive?
